## Develop a Python web app using Solara (an interactive data visualization dashboard).
The code can be adapted for data analytics and data science projects.

- Solara is an alternative to Streamlit, Plotly Dash, and Shiny. 
- It uses a React-style web framework and ipywidgets to quickly transform your data project into a professional looking web application.
- It is a great tool for presenting and sharing a data science project.
